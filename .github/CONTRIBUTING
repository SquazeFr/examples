# Contributions

Contributions are welcome, especially entire projects. If you have a project to
contribute, you must observe the following requirements:

- There must be a README that:
  - Describes the purpose of the project
  - Explains how to build and run any code
  - May attribute authorship to yourself (by mentioning yourself and linking as you prefer)
- All code must be licensed with the MIT license.
- There must be a [LICENSE file] in the root of the repo with the full MIT
  license naming "ChiselStrike, Inc." as the license holder using the current
  year.
- The name of your repo should use all lowercase letters with hyphens as word
  separators (e.g. my-awesome-turso-project). Depending on the type of repo, its
  name should:
  - Start with "app-" if it's an application or other runnable product
  - Start with "lib-" if it's a library or SDK
  - Start with "example-" if it contains code snippets or other examples
  - (or let us know if you have something else)
- The repo must not be a fork of another repo.

Steps to contribute a new repo:

1. Stage your repo on an organization you own (e.g. your personal org)
2. Reach out to us at on our [Discord] or <info@turso.tech> to provide a
   link and ask for a review.
3. We will review your submission, possibly offering suggestions.
4. After we accept it, fork this repo, create a new branch e.g "adding-app-my-project", [follow these steps to add your repo as a subdirectory], and make a new Pull Request.
